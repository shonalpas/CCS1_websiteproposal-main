<h1 class="vmg"> VISION </h1>

<div class="vmg_wrapper">
    <p class="vmg_p"> 
        In a world where common sense is not so common, International State 
        College of the Philippines envisions itself as the epitome of perplexity, where students 
        navigate a labyrinth of bureaucracy, absurdity, and occasional enlightenment. We aspire 
        to produce graduates who excel at decoding incomprehensible forms, mastering the art of 
        waiting in long queues, and embracing the chaos of life with a smile. </p>
</div>


<h1 class="vmg"> MISSION </h1>
<div class="vmg_wrapper">
    <p class="vmg_p">
        At International State College of the Philippines, our mission is to create a surreal and 
        mind-boggling academic environment where students learn the fine art of expecting the 
        unexpected. We are committed to offering a curriculum that challenges the very fabric of 
        logic, encouraging students to question their sanity while navigating through a maze of 
        contradictory instructions. We aim to foster a sense of camaraderie among our students, 
        bonding over shared confusion and disbelief, as they embark on a journey filled with 
        inexplicable rules and regulations. </p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="vmg"> GOALS </h1>
    <div class="vmg_wrapper">
        <p class="vmg_p">
            1. Promote Perplexity:
            <br>
            We strive to bewilder our students with a curriculum that defies 
            conventional understanding. Through convoluted lectures, cryptic 
            assignments, and mind-boggling exam questions, we aim to keep our 
            students in a perpetual state of bewilderment.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Embrace Bureaucratic Brilliance:
            <br>
            We are dedicated to perfecting the art of bureaucracy. Our goal is 
            to create a bureaucracy so intricate and convoluted that students 
            and staff alike are left in awe of its complexity. We will achieve 
            this by introducing an ever-expanding array of forms, each more 
            perplexing than the last.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Champion Absurdity:
            <br>
            We intend to celebrate the absurd in all its glory. From organizing events that defy all logic to implementing rules that make no sense whatsoever, we will actively promote a culture of delightful absurdity on our campus.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            4. Master the Art of Waiting: 
            <br>
            We aim to transform waiting into a transcendent experience. Through long queues, inexplicable delays, and impromptu cancellations, we will teach our students the virtue of patience, one never-ending line at a time.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Create a Community of Confusion: 
            <br>
            We strive to build a community where confusion is not just tolerated but embraced. By organizing seminars on topics that nobody understands and hosting workshops that leave participants scratching their heads, we will foster a sense of unity among our bewildered student body. 
        </p>
    </div>

<h1 class="vmg"> VALUES </h1>
<div class="vmg_wrapper">
    <p class="vmg_p">
        1. Absurd Adaptability:
        <br>
         We value the ability to adapt to the most nonsensical of situations. Our students will learn to thrive in environments where the rules change daily, and logic is a distant memory. Embracing the absurdity of life will be a core value instilled in every graduate.

        <br>
        <br>
        2. Persevering Patience: 
        <br>
        We believe in the power of patience, especially in the face of interminable bureaucracy. Our students will develop the stamina to endure endless waiting, navigating convoluted processes with grace, and finding serenity in the midst of chaos.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Creative Confusion: 
        <br>
        We encourage the cultivation of creative confusion. Our students will be inspired to think outside the box, finding innovative solutions to problems that seem to make no sense at all. Embracing the confusion will lead to innovative thinking and a unique perspective on the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        4. Collaborative Chaos: 
        <br>
        We promote collaboration in the midst of chaos. Our graduates will learn to work harmoniously in groups, even when the tasks at hand seem utterly bewildering. Teamwork in times of uncertainty will be a hallmark of our alumni.
        <br>
        <br>

        5. Mindful Madness: 
        <br>
        We emphasize the importance of mindfulness in the face of madness. Our students will be taught to maintain their sanity amidst the insanity, finding moments of clarity and calmness even in the most absurd situations. Mindful madness will be a skill that sets our graduates apart.
        <br>
        <br>

        6. Surreal Respect:
        <br>
         We cultivate respect for the surreal. Our students will learn to appreciate the bizarre, respect the inexplicable, and honor the unconventional. Embracing diversity of thought and valuing the surreal experiences of others will be at the core of our educational philosophy.
