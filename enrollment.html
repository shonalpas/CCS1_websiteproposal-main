    <h3 class="adm"> PROCEDURES </h3>
    <div class="admissions_wrapper">
    <p class="admissions_p">

        Step 1: Telepathic Aptitude Test
        <br>
        To ensure our students are intellectually advanced, we conduct a telepathic aptitude test. Candidates must demonstrate their ability to communicate using only their minds. Don't worry if you've never tried this before; just think really hard about your favorite food, and we'll pick up on it.
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 2: Synchronized Swimming Audition
        <br>
        Education is not just about the mind; it's about the body too! Candidates must showcase their synchronized swimming skills in a pool filled with academic textbooks. Bonus points if you can recite Shakespearean sonnets while executing a perfect backflip.
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 3: Creative Excuse Writing
        <br>
        We believe in nurturing creativity, especially when it comes to making excuses. Applicants must submit a list of the most imaginative excuses they can come up with for missing classes or assignments. Points will be awarded for creativity, humor, and believability. Bonus points for including extraterrestrial encounters in your excuses.
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 4: Pet Interview
        <br>
        Your pet's opinion matters to us! Bring your furry, feathery, or scaly friend for a one-on-one interview with our resident therapy animals. We want to know if your pet thinks you're ready for college. If your goldfish nods in approval, you're in!
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 5: Pie-Eating Contest
        <br>
        Because why not? A classic pie-eating contest will be held, and contestants will be judged based on their ability to eat pie while discussing complex philosophical concepts. The messier, the better. Extra points for eloquence with a mouthful of blueberry filling.
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 6: Impersonation Challenge
        <br>
        Show off your acting skills by impersonating famous historical figures, mythical creatures, or even inanimate objects. Bonus points if you can convincingly impersonate a library book whispering secrets to readers.
        <br>
        <br>

        Step 7: Singing in the Rain
        <br>
        In a nod to the classic movie, candidates must perform a musical number in the pouring rain. Extra points for incorporating algebraic equations into the lyrics or performing a rain dance that accurately predicts the weather for the next month.
